									roller-1.0
**********************************************************************
I was motivated by 3 reasons to write roller, 
(1) To learn the c/c++ language which was motivated by (2),
Which is contributing to the Haiku project and (3)
I like to see several wallpapers in one day on my Desktop
So the idea of writing Roller was born....... my first c++ app ever.
